				Machine learning (ML) is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides the system with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience rather than explicit programming
				Machine learning is changing the world by transforming all segments including healthcare services, education, transport, food, entertainment, and different assembly line and many more. It will impact lives in almost every aspect, including housing, cars, shopping, food orderin:
				The technology's main purpose is to develop the algorithms for machine learning with the help of which you can achieve automatic data processing. So, instead of writing additional code, developers may put the data inside of an algorithm that is working on it's self-perfection all the time by searching for data patterns.

				Even Machine Learning, Artificial intelligence and deep learning have the most positive impact on the society, They also have some huge dark side which the biggest the society currently is facing. 
				The negative effects of ML, AI and Deep Learning on society can be referred to as the result of poor and inefficient use of technology which can affect society in terms of health or security values
				This Dark side of Machine Learning in society is arising due to ill use or over-usage of The technology. Here are the biggest negative impact that Machine have on the society.
